# Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

# Note:

# All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
# The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
# The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
# You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
# Example 1:

# Input:
# 26

# Output:
# "1a"

class Solution:
    def toHex(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if num == 0: return "0"
        dic = "0123456789abcdef"
        res = ""
        for i in range(8):
            n = num & 15
            c = dic[n]
            res = c + res
            num >>= 4
        return res.lstrip("0")
