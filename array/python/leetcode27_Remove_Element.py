# Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

# Example 1:

# Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

# Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

# It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
